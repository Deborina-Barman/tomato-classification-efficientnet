# Tomato Classification using EfficientNet-B7


## Overview
This project uses the **EfficientNet-B7** deep learning model for classifying different types of tomatoes. The goal is to explore transfer learning for achieving high accuracy on a multi-class classification problem. 
## Features
- Multi-class tomato classification.
- Efficient transfer learning with **EfficientNet-B7**.
- High accuracy and performance optimization.
- Visualizations of training and results.
## Dataset
- **Source:** Mention where the dataset came from (e.g., Kaggle, public dataset, etc.).
- **Size:** Indicate the number of images, categories, and any preprocessing steps.
- **Link:** If the dataset is publicly available, include the link.
## Results
- **Accuracy:** Achieved an accuracy of [add your accuracy, e.g., 95%].
- **Loss:** Final loss value: [add the loss value].
- **Confusion Matrix:** Add a description or image of the confusion matrix.
- **Graphs:** Include training and validation accuracy/loss graphs.
